Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project 

### Purpose

Louise is an upcoming playwriter who is looking to fund her play, "Fever." She is estimating a high budget of around $12,000 and is hesitant to start her campaign. The purpose of this project is to help Louise uncover trends that make a successful campaign. Data was compiled into a crowdfunding platform titled Kickstarter where over 4,000 campaigns are listed. These campaigns have raised money for projects similar to Louise's project. Using Excel, we analyzed the data to identify the trends and factors that made an event either successful, failed, or cancelled. The analysis was tailored to specifically focus on theatrical plays in order to give Louise the best analysis on creating a successful campaign for her play.
